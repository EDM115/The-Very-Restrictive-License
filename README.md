# :lock: The Very Restrictive License

## :thinking: Purpose

The whole purpose of this license is to be very restrictive, while still being a "valid" open-source license.  
To be honest I don't know if it would hold in court, but anyway pretend it does. And call Saul if it doesn't.  

> [!NOTE]  
> At the beginning, I wanted to make this license have a goofy name, like "No Touchy My Codey License" or "Don't Sue Me License", inspired by the [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL), or... [whatever the fuck this is](https://plusnigger.org/).  
> But in the end I decided to give it a more professional name (only to still have a very goofy content).  

I know y'all lazy af to actually read it, so here's a quick breakdown of the license :  

**:white_check_mark: Permissions :**
- Private use
- Modification

**:x: Restrictions :**
- Commercial use
- Distribution
- Sublicensing
- Patent use

**:vertical_traffic_light: Conditions :**
- Include license
- State changes
- Disclose source
- Same license

**:construction: Limitations :**
- Liability
- Warranty
- Trademark use
- Infringement

There are also more clauses :
- Any modifications are covered by the license
- The owner must be notified of modifications
- Any use outside of the license is forbidden, except if you get a written permission from the owner
- Breaking the license will terminate it and the rights granted by it
- The license is available until either 10 years after the owner's death, or 25 years after the last modification of the project, whichever comes last

Oh yeah, and don't think I written the verbatim all on my own, I ain't yapping like that :speaking_head:  
So ChatGPT helped me with it (ofc, what did you expect ?).  

## :memo: Usage

**Regular**  
Simply copy-paste the content of [TVRL.txt](./TVRL.txt) in your project's root directory in a file named `LICENSE` (without extension), and you're good to go.  
The sentence `through third-party utilities under unrestricted open access` in the Preface is subject to change depending on the project, you can either remove it or replace it with something else. It is however here to represent the vast majority of cases.  

**Special provisions**  
There's a special version of the TVRL for projects that include one or several directories that are covered by another license. In that case, you can use the [TVRL_SP.txt](./TVRL_SP.txt) file instead.  

**What to edit**
- Replace `<INSERT NAME>` with your name or your organization's name
- Replace `<INSERT YEAR>` with the year where the project was created, with or without the current year/the year where the project ended (ex : 2022-2024)

*Special provisions*
- Replace `<INSERT DIRECTORY>` with the name of the directory that is covered by another license
- Replace `<INSERT LICENSE NAME>` with the name of the license that covers the directory
- Replace `<INSERT LICENSE CONTENT, INDENTED BY 2 SPACES>` with the verbatim of the license that covers the directory, well, indented by 2 spaces

## :question: Why so restrictive ?

I needed a license like that for a project where I didn't had the rights over a huge part of the material.  
And such license wasn't available, so I said "Fuck it, we ball" and created my own.  
The 10 and 25 years clause weren't necessary but seemed really funny to include.  

## :interrobang: Why aren't you using this license in its own repo ??

Because this would be very stupid and wouldn't allow anyone to use it at all.  
This is why this repo is covered by the Do What the Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL), so feel free to make a copy under another name with other conditions !  

## :unamused: I don't like it

Cool. As stated above, you can create a new one or use a completely different license.  
Check [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/) and [The Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/license).
